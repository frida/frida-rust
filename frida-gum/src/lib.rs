//! Gum bindings for Rust
//!
//! Gum provides a number of utilities for instrumenting binary applications,
//! and traditionally is consumed via the JavaScript API known as GumJS.
//! This crate aims to provide a complete interface to the instrumentation
//! API provided by Gum, rather than GumJS (s.t. these bindings exclude the `Java` and `ObjC`
//! modules).
//!
//! # Quick Start
//! First, ensure that your platform is supported by Gum. You can find a listing of
//! development kits on the [Frida releases page](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases).
//! To get started using Gum, you need to obtain a global [`Gum`] object; this is required
//! to safely ensure that Gum has been properly initialized as required. Next, you are
//! free to use any available APIs, such as the [`stalker::Stalker`]:
//! ```
//! use frida_gum::{Gum, stalker::{Stalker, Transformer, NoneEventSink}};
//! use lazy_static::lazy_static;
//!
//! lazy_static! {
//!     static ref GUM: Gum = unsafe { Gum::obtain() };
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut stalker = Stalker::new(&GUM);
//!
//!     let transformer = Transformer::from_callback(&GUM, |basic_block, _output| {
//!         for instr in basic_block {
//!             instr.keep();
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     stalker.follow_me::<NoneEventSink>(&transformer, None);
//!     stalker.unfollow_me();
//! }
//! ```
