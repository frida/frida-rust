//! Code tracing engine.
//!
//! More details about the Frida Stalker can be found on the [Stalker page](https://frida.re/docs/stalker/)
//! of the Frida documentation.
//!
//! The Rust interface to the Stalker provides a best-effort "safe" interface,
//! but naturally runtime code modification takes great caution and
//! these bindings cannot prevent all types of misbehaviour resulting in misuse
//! of the Stalker interface.
//!
//! # Examples
//! To trace the current thread with the Stalker, create a new [`Stalker`] and [`Transformer`] and call
//! [`Stalker::follow_me()`]:
//! ```
//! # use frida_gum::Gum;
//! # use frida_gum::stalker::{Stalker, Transformer};
//! #[cfg(feature = "event-sink")]
//! use frida_gum::stalker::NoneEventSink;
//! let gum = unsafe { Gum::obtain() };
//! let mut stalker = Stalker::new(&gum);
//!
//! let transformer = Transformer::from_callback(&gum, |basic_block, _output| {
//!     for instr in basic_block {
//!         instr.keep();
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! #[cfg(feature = "event-sink")]
//! stalker.follow_me::<NoneEventSink>(&transformer, None);
//!
//! #[cfg(not(feature = "event-sink"))]
//! stalker.follow_me(&transformer);
//!
//! stalker.unfollow_me();
//! ```
